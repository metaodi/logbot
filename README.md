Logbot
=======

Logbot is a slackbot to log/stash whatever is on your mind while using slack.
It let's you later retrieve this messages, along with the time when you saves them.

One specific use case is to quickly note down activities you do to make it easier to fill in your timesheets later on.
This is where the intergration with [cabdriver](https://github.com/metaodi/cabdriver) comes in handy.

## Development

To run the bot locally and expose it to the internet, use `localtunnel`:

```
lt --port 8765 --subdomain logbotcmd
```
